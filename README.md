## Challenges

### Ruby
1. Let's revisit the Star Wars API Project that we did a few weeks ago. A character has many films, a film has many characters. How would you model this out in plain old ruby?

1. What Ruby classes do you need to model this?

  + Character
  + Film
  + Appearance 

2. Implement those classes so that they all respond to a method called `.all` that returns an array of all of those instances.


`Zorp.all #=> []`
